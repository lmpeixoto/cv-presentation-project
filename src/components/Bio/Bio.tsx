            <p>
                Hi, I'm Lu√≠s! I'm a pharmacist and I have a passion for
                programming. Since I was a teenager I got to know some
                programming languages, from C, Pascal, and Basic. At one point,
                I came across the computer science classes at MIT Opencourseware
                and decided to take it more seriously. That's when I thought
                about making the career switch to programmer. I attended a
                master's degree in bioinformatics, where I dedicated more to
                machine learning and deep learning. Since the job market was
                richer in job offers for web development with a javascript
                stack, on the advice of some friends in the area, I decided to
                dedicate myself more to this stack. It was then that I started
                doing some personal projects in javascript, using frameworks
                like Express, React and Mongo DB as a database. As I had no
                experience in the real world of work I thought it was a good
                investment to volunteer in an open source project -
                FightPandemics. Here I acquired some fluency in working methods
                and the small daily challenges of a programmer. In addition to
                programming, I am passionate about photography, music and
                literature.
